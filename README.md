# Axiom Verge SRT Pipeline

## What is this?

For tournaments and competitive speedrunning events, it's desirable for the hosts to be able to track the runner's progress in game in real time. Axiom Verge has a websocket API built into it, but it's only accessible through `localhost`. This program pushes it out to the remote relay used by the excellent [SRT framework](https://github.com/Squirrelies/SRTHost).

## What is this if I'm not a programmer?

This lets you run Axiom on one computer and get widgets for it on a separate computer anywhere in the world.

## Installation

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/axiom-verge-speedrunning/av-to-srt-relay/releases), download the appropriate executable for your platform, and double click to launch it. It'll prompt you to put in your username, and then you're good to go!

## Issues/Support

If you're having any trouble getting this working, reach out to the mod team in the [official Axiom Verge Discord](https://discord.gg/hngJJgz) and we'll get it fixed.
